Hello world!

Today's lesson was about Version Control System and basic commands of GIT.

Today we learned about databeses and its problems. We created our own pokemon centers and used a random generator to create random orders and recorded them on a spreadsheet.

Today we learned more about databases. We learned about key attributes and how to use them to create smaller independent tables such as pokemons, trainers, and centers.

Today we learned about Entity sets and ER Diagrams. We learned to use different symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relations in a diagram.

Today we learned more about entity-relationship models. We learned about relationship roles, subclasses, and weak entity sets.

Today we applied what we learned about ER models on more complex examples. We created ER diagrams for leagues, teams, players, positions, captains, fans, persons, matches, scores, stadiums.. etc.

Today we took a test about ER diagrams. There were three questions and it was difficult.

Today we designed another ER diagram. I worked with Clement as a group to create a presentation on the ER diagram. We also listened to other students' presentations and critiqued their diagrams.

Today we entered the second phase of the course. We learned to convert ER diagrams, a higher level of representation, to Relational Models, a lower level of representation.

Today we learned about normals forms. There was normal form one, two, and three. We tried to come up with our own normal form three, and we critiqued each others' relational models.
