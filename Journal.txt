Hello world!

Today's lesson was about Version Control System and basic commands of GIT.

Today we learned about databeses and its problems. We created our own pokemon centers and used a random generator to create random orders and recorded them on a spreadsheet.

Today we learned more about databases. We learned about key attributes and how to use them to create smaller independent tables such as pokemons, trainers, and centers.

Today we learned about Entity sets and ER Diagrams. We learned to use different symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relations in a diagram.

Today we learned more about entity-relationship models. We learned about relationship roles, subclasses, and weak entity sets.

Today we applied what we learned about ER models on more complex examples. We created ER diagrams for leagues, teams, players, positions, captains, fans, persons, matches, scores, stadiums.. etc.

Today we took a test about ER diagrams. There were three questions and it was difficult.

Today we designed another ER diagram. I worked with Clement as a group to create a presentation on the ER diagram. We also listened to other students' presentations and critiqued their diagrams.

Today we entered the second phase of the course. We learned to convert ER diagrams, a higher level of representation, to Relational Models, a lower level of representation.

Today we learned about normals forms. There was normal form one, two, and three. We tried to come up with our own normal form three, and we critiqued each others' relational models.

Today we tried to find errors in other databases. Then we used real-life data to make a relationship model. We first made ER models by writing on paper. Then we typed the relational models and put them on google slides.

Today we learned about the importance of denormalization. Normalization focuses of reducing redundancy, while denormalization may sometimes increase performance. Then we presented our relation schemas.

Today we attempted to explain to an 8-year old what BCNF is. Then we signed up in Kaggle to have access to real life database.

Today we have time to work on our real life databases. I was working on Burritos in California. I had a little nap.

Today we are again given time to work on our databases. I am finished with first, second, and third normalizations. All I need is explain. We will be learning SQL next class!
