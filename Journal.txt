Hello world!

Today's lesson was about Version Control System and basic commands of GIT.

Today we learned about databeses and its problems. We created our own pokemon centers and used a random generator to create random orders and recorded them on a spreadsheet.

Today we learned more about databases. We learned about key attributes and how to use them to create smaller independent tables such as pokemons, trainers, and centers.

Today we learned about Entity sets and ER Diagrams. We learned to use different symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relations in a diagram.

Today we learned more about entity-relationship models. We learned about relationship roles, subclasses, and weak entity sets.

Today we applied what we learned about ER models on more complex examples. We created ER diagrams for leagues, teams, players, positions, captains, fans, persons, matches, scores, stadiums.. etc.

Today we took a test about ER diagrams. There were three questions and it was difficult.
